### Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose significant challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. As a respiratory disease, it primarily targets the lungs and can cause severe and lasting damage. Common symptoms include difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia and even respiratory failure. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to mitigate these outcomes.

In this project, we aim to leverage chest X-ray data of patients to build a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between normal lungs, COVID-19 positive cases, and other respiratory conditions. The use of transfer learning allows us to train an efficient and accurate model despite limited data.

### Dataset and Models

The dataset used in this study is a well-regarded resource, having won the Kaggle Community Award. It was compiled by researchers from Qatar and Bangladesh and contains three distinct classes of images:
- **COVID-19 positive cases:** 219 images.
- **Viral Pneumonia cases:** 1,341 images.
- **Normal lung X-rays:** 1,345 images.

Given this classification task, the project utilizes the **softmax activation function** in the final layer of the model to handle the three output classes effectively.

**Image details**:
- Dimensions: `(1024, 1024)`
- Channels: 3 (color images)

Interestingly, the authors of the dataset also trained a ResNet-34 model on this data, achieving an impressive accuracy of **98.5%**.

### Implementation

To develop the model for this classification task, we will use the **Xception model**, a state-of-the-art pre-trained neural network available through the Keras API. The Xception model is particularly suited for this task, as it achieved:
- **79% top-1 accuracy** on the ImageNet dataset.
- **95% top-5 accuracy**, making it one of the most reliable models for feature extraction.

The implementation process involves several key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Uses the pre-trained Xception model, fine-tuned for this specific medical classification task.
3. **Model Customization**: Adds fully connected layers to the pre-trained base to adapt it for our three-class classification task.
4. **Training**: Trains the customized model using the dataset with appropriate hyperparameters.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

The first step is to import the necessary modules and libraries required for this project.
